# pythonRPS
A short python rps script
This game takes in command line inputs for the game of Rock Paper Scissors and uses the Python Random library to create an AI player
Using this AI player and the User Input the script checks for validity of the user input and then plays the game
Upon completion of the game the script then handles if the user wishes to play again or not


To use this script, first install python 2.7 on your system, this can be obtained at https://www.python.org/downloads

Run the script with python rps.py
This script expects your inputs to be in the form rock, paper, or scissors, these are case sensitive
It also expects the input to continue to be Yes or No, also case sensitive\

Future versions with include auto run scripts to create executables.
